        <p>HBO’s “Euphoria” season two left many University of Maryland students apprehensive about the upcoming season three.</p>

        <p>In an anonymous survey of many underclassmen at the University of Maryland, ranging from journalism majors to neuroscience majors, 72.2% watched both seasons. When it came down to comparing the two seasons, 44.4% preferred the first season over the second.</p>

        <p>One student wrote, “The first season was unique and something new in entertainment, and brought a new lens to high school in America.” “However, season two I thought was overly sexualized and too full of itself.”<p>

        <p>Grace Blanco, a sophomore biology major, said, “Season one was a lot to take in, but through the pain, it still had this sense of slight innocence and hope around it, but all that was dashed away in season two and it felt more artificially driven by ramping up the stakes so much.”</p>
<!--Callout-->
        <div class="callout calloutStyle">“It did show the full story of how bad addiction can get which was the goal of the director, but I still think that the rest of the plot was driven by petty drama and then taken to the absolute extreme,” Blanco said.</div>

        <p>“Euphoria” is the second most-watched show behind “Game of Thrones,” with season two reaching more than double the viewership of season one, according to a <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/euphoria-season-2-finale-ratings-1235192015/" target="_blank">Variety</a> article. Compared to the first season of “Euphoria” released in the summer of 2019, the second season of “Euphoria” has exceeded viewership expectations and odds, according to a <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/euphoria-season-2-ratings-viewership-up-1235167603/" target="_blank">Variety</a> article.</p>

        <p>According to one of the <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/euphoria-season-2-finale-ratings-1235192015/" target="_blank">Variety</a> articles written by Jennifer Maas, compared to the 6.6 million viewers collected from the first season, the second season is reaching a whopping 19 million viewers in the U.S.</p>

        <p>Both seasons have followed the same release plan, where each week a new episode airs. Now, with HBO and HBO Max, audiences have more access to watch the show live.</p>

        <p>“Euphoria” is a show based on a group of friends and enemies who handle a multitude of real-life conflicts while in high school, including drug addiction, alcohol consumption, discussions on sexual and gender identity, relationships, cheating, death and the bad habits surrounding these teenagers.</p>

        <p>Rue <em>(Zendaya)</em>, one of the main characters of the show, is introduced in the first season by returning from rehab, to which she immediately relapses and continues buying drugs from her dealer, Fezco, <em>(Angus Cloud)</em> according to a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/entertainment/euphoria-season-1-recap" target="_blank">Bustle</a> season one synopsis.</p>

        <p>In season two she meets Jules <em>(Hunter Schafer)</em>, and a strong friendship and romance grow, only to be left questioning what happens between the two when they both decide to run away but Jules is the only one who leaves town.</p>

        <p>The other girls in their group, Maddy <em>(Alexa Demie)</em>, Cassie <em>(Sydney Sweeney)</em> and Kat <em>(Barbie Ferreira)</em>, all struggle with their own conflicts throughout this season. Maddy with her toxic and abusive boyfriend Nate <em>(Jacob Elordi)</em>, Cassie and her relationship with McKay <em>(Algee Smith)</em>, and Kat with her relationship with Ethan <em>(Austin Abrams)</em> and her fight to take charge of her body and sexuality, according to the synopsis.</p> 

        <p>Nate’s storyline unfolds as a child when he finds his father made recordings of himself having sexual intercourse with trans women and gay men, forming a conflicting relationship with his father and anger issues many times taken out on his girlfriend Maddy, according to the synopsis.</p>

        <p>It’s important to note Cassie has a sister Lexi <em>(Maude Apatow)</em> who used to be very close with Rue before her father died and she turned to drugs. Lexi becomes a much more dominant character in season two.</p>

        <p>New characters join the ranks in the publication of season two and complicate relationships further. Elliot <em>(Dominic Fike)</em> wedges himself between Rue and Jules, Cassie gets into a relationship with Maddy’s ex Nate, Kat tries to break things off with her boyfriend Ethan and Fezco and Lexi seems to have a growing fling, according to <a href="https://dailytargum.com/article/2022/03/your-euphoria-season-2-recap-shaky-script-saved-by-flawless-performances" target="_blank">The Daily Tagram</a> season two synopsis.</p> 

        <p>One of the bigger plotlines of the most recent season is Lexi’s play, in which she wrote about her life and her experiences with all of the characters listed above. Towards the end of the season, she strengthens her relationship with Rue, while Fezco and Ashtray, his younger “brother,” deal with an ongoing crime that seems to leave Ashtray <em>(Javon Walton)</em> shot and dead by police.</p> 

        <p>There is a lot of chaos, romance and violence occurring throughout these seasons, and season three is soon approaching, further instigating the drama. According to the anonymous survey of underclassmen, almost every student is still looking forward to season three after they felt left on a “cliffhanger” during the finale of season two.</p>

        <p>Many hope to see all the characters continue their personal plots and fill in holes throughout the past two seasons. Blanco said that she wants to see a bigger focus on love again, and less on violence.</p> 

        <p>“I would like to see a lowering of stakes and bringing the focus back to relationships and the different forms of love these characters share with each other,” she concluded.<p> 

        <p>“Euphoria” season three has officially been renewed as of February, with an unclear date of release.</p>
