<h2><font face="times">What kind of music do I listen to?</font></font></h2>

<p><font face="times"><font color="black">I like all different genres of music, but my favorite genre is pop music and DJ music, along with top hits. I am a fan of some rap music, some country and others, but I will always return to my roots...<strong>pop!</strong> I got Spotify years back, as I had never used Apple Music before. When I was younger I remember purchasing some songs by 5 Seconds of Summer on there, but that was it. Overall, I am a music fanatic. I listen to music wherever I go. It could be going to the gym, walking to class, doing homework, etc. Music helps me de-stress and makes me feel good especially when I had a bad or stressful day. I love the ability to create different playlists, follow artists and your friends, and always have the opportunity to find new music. Although I love the oldies I have on my playlists and library, I am always looking to find more music to add.</font></font></p>

<h3>Here is a list of some of my top artists:</h3>

<ol>
	<li><font color="purple"><strong>Doja Cat</strong></font></li>
		<ul>
			<li>She was my top artist last year according to Spotify Wrapped. Her new album <em>Planet Her</em> was an all-time favorite and one of those albums I listened to all summer.</li>
			<li>My top song last year was "Why Why," by Doja Cat herself.</li>
			<br>
		</ul>
	<li><font color="red"><strong>5 Seconds of Summer</strong></font></li>
		<ul>
			<li>5sos has been one of my favorite bands since middle school.</li>
			<li>I have seen them in concert eight times, and am planning on seeing them for the ninth time this summer.</li>
			<li>I know every song word for word, and their recent album <em>Calm</em> is definitely a favorite, but I also love their older music.</li>
			<li>They released a new song called "2011," which I've had on repeat.</li>
			<br>
		</ul>
	<li><font color="pink"><strong>The Chainsmokers</strong></font></li>
		<ul>
			<li>I just recently became a bigger fan of The Chainsmokers.</li>
			<li>I saw them in concert twice before 2020, and fell in love with them again!</li>
			<li>They are releasing a new album soon and I'm super excited for it.</li>
			<br>

		</ul>
	<li><font color="blue"><strong>Morgan Wallen</strong></font></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Ever since his new album <em>Dangerous</em> was released in 2021, I became a huge fan of his music.</li>
			<li>Although a country artist, his music has that pop sound to it which pulled me in.</li>
			<li>I do know most of the songs he's written and sung for that album and I'm excited to hear new music.</li>
			<br>
		</ul>
