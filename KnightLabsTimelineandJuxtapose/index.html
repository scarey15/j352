          <h2>Marvel Studios Franchise</h2>
          <p>The Marvel Studios Franchise began its release of movies based on Marvel comics in the early 2000's. They have released a multitude of films, including sequels, prequels and more. Currently, Phase One through Phase Three movies in the timeline have been released, and Phase Four has begun with new movies coming down the road. This franchise hosts some of my most favorite movies and favorite heroes, including Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Vision and more. To the right, you will see the change in time of one of my favorites, Captain America, also known as actor Chris Evans. Below, you will find a timeline of the Marvel movies in their chronological order.</p>
