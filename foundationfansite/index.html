            <h3><font face="times">What kind of music do I listen to?</font></font></h3>
            <p><font face="times"><font color="black">I like all different genres of music, but my favorite genre is pop music and DJ music, along with top hits. I am a fan of some rap music, some country and others, but I will always return to my roots...<strong>pop!</strong> I got Spotify years back, as I had never used Apple Music before. When I was younger I remember purchasing some songs by 5 Seconds of Summer on there, but that was it. Overall, I am a music fanatic. I listen to music wherever I go. It could be going to the gym, walking to class, doing homework, etc. Music helps me de-stress and makes me feel good especially when I had a bad or stressful day. I love the ability to create different playlists, follow artists and your friends, and always have the opportunity to find new music. Although I love the oldies I have on my playlists and library, I am always looking to find more music to add.</font></font></p>
